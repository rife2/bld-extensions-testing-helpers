/**
 * JUnit extension that handles retry logic for test methods annotated
 * with the {@link RetryTest} annotation.
 * <p>
 * This extension will execute a test method multiple times on failure
 * based on the parameters specified in the {@link RetryTest} annotation.
 * It also supports adding a delay between retries to allow external
 * systems or resources to stabilize.
 * <p>
 * The extension uses {@link TestExecutionExceptionHandler} to intercept
 * and handle exceptions thrown during test execution. If the test succeeds
 * in any of the retry attempts, it is marked as passed. Otherwise, the
 * last exception thrown is re-thrown to indicate failure.
 * <p>
 * Features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Retries a test upon failure, up to the specified maximum attempts.</li>
 * <li>Optionally introduces a delay between retry attempts.</li>
 * <li>Reports the failure count and exception details for each retry on the console.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Exceptions encountered during the retry process are carefully handled:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If a retry is interrupted during the delay, the thread is re-interrupted,
 * and the {@link InterruptedException} is added as a suppressed exception.</li>
 * <li>The original or last exception encountered is re-thrown when retries are exhausted.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This extension operates on individual test methods and requires them
 * to be annotated with {@link RetryTest} to activate the retry logic.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> Runtime exceptions during retries, such as {@link InvocationTargetException},
 * are unwrapped to reveal the underlying cause.
